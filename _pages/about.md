I am currently a Research Assistant at the <a href="https://www.robinwalters.com/pages/geometric-learning-lab.html">Geometric Learning Lab</a>, Northeastern University, working under the guidance of <a href="https://www.robinwalters.com/">Prof. Robin Walters</a>. My research centers on geometric deep learning, with a focus on 3D shape generation and inverse modeling. I am particularly interested in developing and refining deep learning models that leverage geometric structure to solve complex problems in 3D data analysis, including radar signal processing and generative modeling for 3D geometry.

I completed my Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence at the Khoury College of Computer Sciences, Northeastern University, where I gained a strong foundation in machine learning, computer vision, and geometric deep learning, graduating with a GPA of 3.70/4.00. My academic journey has been shaped by a passion for understanding the mathematical underpinnings of AI and applying them to real-world challenges.

Previously, I earned my Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering from SRM Institute of Science and Technology, India. During my undergraduate studies, I was an active member of Team SRMAUV, mentored by <a href="https://www.srmist.edu.in/faculty/dr-annapurani-panaiyappan-k/">Dr. Annapurani Panaiyappan K</a>. There, I contributed to the development of the vision suite for an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), enhancing the image processing pipeline with advanced deep learning techniques for underwater object detection and publishing a comprehensive survey on software design for underwater vehicles.

I am passionate about advancing the field of geometric deep learning and am always eager to collaborate on innovative projects at the intersection of AI, geometry, and real-world applications.

Outside of research, I am passionate about training in martial arts and staying active at the gym. I also enjoy playing basketball and soccer.
